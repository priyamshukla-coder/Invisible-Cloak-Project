# Invisible-Cloak-Project

This project is based on Computer Vision techniques. It is basically built using OpenCV by segmenting a single predefined colour from a video footage and replacing it with a pre-existing background.
This creates a immersion of Invisibility Cloak.

Blue color will be masked.
